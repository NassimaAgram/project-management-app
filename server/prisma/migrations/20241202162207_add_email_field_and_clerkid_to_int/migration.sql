/*
  Warnings:

  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[email]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `email` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `clerkId` on the `User` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
